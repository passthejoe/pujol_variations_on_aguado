# Antonio de Torres: The beginning of the modern classical guitar

Torres guitars are divided into two "eras,' the first era (FE) from 1852-1869 and second era from 1875-1892. After he resumed building guitars in 1875, Torres marked his guitars on their label as "Segunda epoca."

[The 1888 Antonio de Torres guitar SE 115] owned by Matilde Cuervas (1888-1956), concert artist, duo partner and wife of Emilio Pujol was part of the Russell Cleveland Collection acquired by Guitar Salon International in Santa Monica.

SE 115 (SE for Second Era) was built during the same year as Francisco TÃ¡rrega's favorite Torres, SE 114, according to GSI.

After Curvas' death, Pujol continued to play the historic guitar, donating it to his niece before he died in 1980. Russell Cleveland bought it in 1997.

The spruce-topped SE 115 has mahogany back and sides and a standard 650 mm scale and 52 mm neck width at the nut.

GSI says this about SE 115:

> Words are inadequate in describing just how rich and harmonious the sound is, how perfectly balanced the notes are when they blend together, and the sensation of playing the guitar as it vibrates against the players body. The trebles have an intoxicating, "velvety" texture to the sound and it is remarkable just how sensitive each note is to the slightest change in right hand position - allowing for a wide variety of color and expressivity. The basses are wide and deep, also with great lyrical charm and character. When evaluating the sound of a guitar like this, it's difficult to tell where the genius of Torres ends; and the accumulated years of being played by great artists begins. This instrument is truly a marvel of guitar making history.
