# Emilio Pujol's 15 variations on an exercise by Dionisio Aguado and its place in the four-volume "Escuela Razonada de la Guitarra"

Volume 4 of Emilio Pujol's "Escuela Razonada de la Guitarra" — called *el cuatro libro* in Pujol's *prefecio* to the Spanish/French edition of his detailed 20th century guitar method — is less well-known in the English-speaking world because it was not part of the three-volume Editions Orphée English translation known as "Guitar School."

But Volume 4 is full of technical exercises and instructions, rendered in Spanish and French, of course. As with volumes 2 and 3, *libro quartro* ends with a number of studies. These selections are meant to reinforce various aspects of classical guitar technique but are also very musical.

Among them are a short exercise by 19th-century guitar giant Dionisio Aguado followed by 15 variations composed by Pujol, each focusing on different guitar techniques while at the same time venturing into harmonic territory that is very much of Pujol's time, the later Romantic and early modern periods of classical music.
