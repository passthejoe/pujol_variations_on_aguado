Emilio Pujol's "Escuela Razonda de la Guitarra," according to Pujol's preface, was conceived as an eventual five-volume work in 1923. According to the preface for *el cuatro libro*, the first book (*el primer libro*, as Pujol refers to it in the Spanish *prefacio*) was edited in 1934, the second published in 1940, the third edited in 1934.

Even though this preface appears in the fourth volume, nowhere in that book does it say exactly when *el cuatro libro* appeared, though the edition circulating around the internet of *el primero libro" has a 1954 copyright.

Also in the *prefacio* to *el cuatro libro* is the plan for a fifth volume, which was never published. Some say it exists in manuscript and will be released at some point, but as of August 2020, it hasn't appeared.
