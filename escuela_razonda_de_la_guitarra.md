Emilio Pujol's "Escuela Razonda de la Guitarra," according to Pujol's preface to *libro cuatro*, was conceived as an eventual five-volume work in 1923. Pujol writes that the first book (*el primer libro*, as Pujol refers to it in the Spanish *prefacio*) was edited in 1934, the second published in 1940 and the third edited in 1934.

Even though this preface appears in the fourth volume, nowhere in that book does it say exactly when *el cuatro libro* appeared, though the edition circulating around the internet of *el primero libro" has a 1954 copyright.

The *el cuatro libro* available on the internet as a PDF has a date on the back cover of March 16, 1998.

All four volumes, originally published by Ricordi in Argentina, have text in both Spanish and French. It is the contention of Matanya Ophee, whose Editions Orph√©e published the excellent English translation of volumes 1-3, that Pujol wrote the French text in addition to the Spanish and didn't rely on a translator.

There is a preface in *libro tercero*, dated September 1952, called *proemio* in Spanish

Also in the *prefacio* to *el cuatro libro* is the plan for a fifth volume, which was never published. Some say it exists in manuscript and will be released at some point, but as of August 2020, it hasn't appeared.
