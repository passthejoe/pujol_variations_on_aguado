# Aguado Study No. 19 with 17 variations by Emilio Pujol

This study by Dionisio Aguado (1784-1849) is very familiar to students of the classical guitar, and it appears in many method books.

* It appears on Page 78 of Aaron Shearer's "Classic Guitar Technique," Second Edition, Franco Columbo Publications, 1959 (Copyright assigned to Belwin Inc. in 1969). The Aguado study is the last solo-guitar piece in the book.

Pujol presents Ejercicio No. 19 del MÃ©todo de Aguado with his 17 variations beginning on Page 209 of Volume 4 of "Escuela Razonada de La Guitarra." The 17 variations are presented as Estudio LIV on the lower half of Page 209 through LXX, a fugue ending on Page 229.
