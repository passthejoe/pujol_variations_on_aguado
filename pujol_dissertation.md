# A 701-page doctoral dissertation on Emilio Pujol

I found a 701-page doctoral dissertation on Emilio Pujol that draws heavily on materials and interviews with María Adelaide Robert, Pujol's second wife and widow:

## The dissertation:

While written in Spanish, there are extensive listings of Pujol's compositions, transcriptions, recordings, other publications and concert appearances.

The PDF includes many photographs provided by María Adelaide Robert.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Pujol) on María Adelaide Robert:

	In 1946, Pujol began his guitar classes at the Lisbon Conservatory of Music, which continued through to 1969. During this period he was involved in giving master classes (in 1953 he was personally invited by Andrés Segovia to give classes at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana) and adjudicating at guitar competitions. Also at this time, Pujol's first wife Matilde Cuervas died (1956). Seven years later he married Maria Adelaide Robert, a noted Portuguese pianist and singer who greatly assisted him in his final years.
